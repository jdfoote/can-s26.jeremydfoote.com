title: "NotebookLM as a study partner"

For this assignment, I created a [NotebookLM notebook](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/366fc620-b1ad-46b5-afc0-c74e4a619323) with all of the readings and lecture slides for the course. 

I want you to have a conversation with the AI.

1. Ask it to summarize one of the readings.
2. Look up something really specific from one of the readings, and see if it is correct. (e.g., "What percent of friendships are not reciprocal in the Pentland reading?")
3. Ask it to explain a concept that you found confusing.
4. Ask it about the relationship between two concepts (e.g., "What does Burt's concept of structural holes have to do with Granovetter's concept of weak ties?")
5. Ask it to quiz you on the readings. (e.g., "Quiz me on the key concepts from the Katz et al reading.")
6. Ask it to give you feedback on an idea you have for your final project.

Once you have done this, write a brief reflection (1-2 paragraphs) on your experience. What worked well? What didn't? Were there things that the AI got wrong? How does this compare to other AI tools you have used?
