# Homework and Reading Review

## Class Questions

> - What do you want to talk about today?

## Basic Concepts

> - What is a node?
> - What is an edge?
> - What is the "individual" perspective of data and how does it differ from a network perspective?

## Network Representations

```{r, message=F,warning=F,echo=F}
library(igraph)
set.seed(24)
G = erdos.renyi.game(5, .4)
plot(G)
```

> - What is the edgelist of this graph?
> - What is the matrix representation of this graph?

## Questions from homework?

## Questions from 3-2-1s

> - Is there only one way to graph social connections? So far as we have seen, there has only been one method to graph social network connections, using ties and nodes; are there other ways?
> - If you didn't know whether a network was directed or not, could you know just by looking at the edge list?
> - When would be the case to use a edge list compared to an adjacency list?

## Questions from 3-2-1s

> - What does it mean for a network to be projected?
> - How do researchers deal with multiplex networks? Do they analyze each relation separately, or is there a way to combine them meaningfully?
> - Adjacency lists vs. edge lists vs. matrices

## Discussion Questions


## Consolidation

> - What were some of the key ideas?
> - What are you thinking differently about now?
> - What are remaining questions/confusions?

## Thursday

> - Take ~ an hour to try to install everything, work on R Lab 1
> - Mostly working on R Lab together
