## Self Reflections and feedback

> - Make sure to get them in
> - Overall, things are going well
> - Please give feedback on the Google Form

## Housekeeping

> - Videos + readings on centrality and power
> - How do we measure who is important and influential?
> - AI assignment next week
> - Thursday
>   - Ego network activity
>   - More co-working time

## Debugging

Strategies when R code doesn't work:

> - Simplify
> - print()
> - ChatGPT
> - Google!
> - Friends

## Homework Review

## Review

> - What is an "ego network"?
> - What are the benefits of having a dense ego network?
> - What are the benefits of having a sparse ego network?

## Dense Network Example

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(2025)
play_gnp(10, 0.6) |>
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = '#33679bff') + 
  theme_graph()
```

## Sparse Network Example

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(2029)
play_gnp(10, 0.15) |>
  ggraph(layout = 'fr') + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = '#339b6aff') + 
  theme_graph()


#edges <- c('Alara', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'Alara', 'Sharvani', 'Lucy', 'Sharvani', 'Alyssa', 'Nik', 'Logan', 'Nik', 'Cole', 'Nik', 'Brandon', 'Brandon', 'Cole', 'Brandon', 'Logan', 'Brandon', 'Nik')# 'Logan', 'Nik', 'Logan', 'Cole', 'Logan', 'Brandon')
#g <- make_graph(edges, directed = T)
#
#g |> 
#  as_tbl_graph() |>
#  ggraph(layout = 'fr') + 
#  # Arrows that don't overlap nodes
#  geom_edge_fan(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name), end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)), arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, 'mm')), alpha = 0.5) + 
#  geom_node_point(size = 8, color = '#9b3333ff') + 
#  theme_graph()

```


## Review

> - What are some reasons that you think friendship can be asymmetrical?
> - Is there such thing as a "true" social network? How could we find it out?
> - What are some ways that our perceptions of a network could influence our behaviors?

<aside class='notes'>
- Different perception of "friendship"
- Different cognitive activation (who comes to mind)
- Ambition / social status
</aside>

## Review

> - What is the "cognitive activation" of a network? What is mobilization?
> - Why might SES be related to which networks are activated in stress?

## Discussion Questions

> - Perceived vs. "actual" networks
> - How do we measure "actual" networks?
> - Tie strength, density, and herd mentality

## Summary

# Thursday class


# Ego Network Activity

## What do our ego networks look like?

> - From time to time, most people discuss important matters with other people. Looking back over the last 6 months, who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you?

## Making Connections

- Make an edgelist for each connection, with tie strength of:
	- Total strangers: 0
	- Especially close: 1
	- In between: .5

## Write attributes of your connections to a node attribute file

 - Sex
 - Education (years of education)
 - Race
 - Age
 - Kin or non-kin (are they related to you?)


## Calculate your statistics

- Network size
- Kin network size
- Non-kin network size
- Density
- Age heterogeneity
- Education heterogeneity
- Race heterogeneity
- Sex heterogeneity (proportion in majority)


## Importing and visualizing in R
> - Remember `graph_from_data_frame()`

<!--
# Old Slides


> - Thank you so much for being open and honest!
> - Some summary thoughts
>	- Things are going pretty well
>	- R is hard but people are persisting
> - Cold calling is scary

## My plans for change

> - Try to make more time for small group discussion
>	- A few minutes at the beginning of class


## Suggestions for success

> - Keep working on assignments that you missed / got wrong
> - Ask questions on Discord
> - Come to office hours
