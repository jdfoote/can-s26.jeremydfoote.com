## Dad Joke

The guy who stole my diary died yesterday.

# Troubled Lands Review

## Questions from Brightspace Assignment

> - How did you play differently in different versions?
> - What in real life is similar to each version of the game?
> - How did you decide whether or not to help others?
> - What does this have to do with social networks and social capital?!


## Debrief

> - What did you think about while playing?
> - How did you feel as you played? Did those feeling change across different versions of the game?
> - When do you help others in real life?

## Debrief

> - Were resources and abilities distributed fairly?
> - How should resources be distributed in the real world?
> - What role did communication play? How did your group make decisions?
> - Did you work to make things equal? Why or why not?
> - What kinds of inequality appeared in the game?
--->

## Community Detection Review

> - What is a component? (Hint: there's often one "giant" component)
> - What is a clique?
> - What is the weakness of cliques as a way of identifying groups?
> - What is a k-plex? (Hint: related to cliques)
> - The goal of most community detection algorithms is high modularity. What does that mean?

## Core and Periphery Review

> - Why do groups often have a core and a periphery?
> - Given some of the other theories we've talked about, how would you expect the periphery to differ from the core?
> - What role does the periphery have in protests (Barberá et al. reading)?
> - What is one way to identify who is in the core or periphery?

## Coreness Example

<div class='col fragment'>
```{r,message=F}
UK |>
  activate(nodes) |>
  mutate(coreness = node_coreness()) |>
ggraph(layout='stress') +
  geom_edge_fan(alpha=.3) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color=coreness)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(name='Coreness')
```

</div>

## Discussion Questions

> - How can random walks identify communities?
> - Do k-plexes really happen? Are you really connected to everyone but one person?
> - Do all groups have a periphery?
> - Clustering coefficient
> - Rich club coefficient
> - Homophily vs. cliques

## Visualization Challenge Review

> - Glanced at a handful and they are quite good!
> - Discussion about LLMs and coding
>   - I have been intentionally vague
>   - I want you to learn computational thinking, learn syntax of R
>   - I also want you to learn how to use AI to do cool stuff!
>   - I'm torn about what to expect / how to encourage
>   - Fundamental knowledge makes AI stuff easier

## Further AI discussion 

> - Similar concerns about AI-augmented reading.
>   - AI can help us to understand deeper, or to pretend that we understand deeper.
>   - How can instructors encourage the former?
